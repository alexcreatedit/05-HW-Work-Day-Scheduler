# 05-HW-Work-Day-Scheduler
# For this homework assignment the goal is to make a day planner, while having the current day showing.
# Started by adjusting style sheet in my html so that it shows my link css file. 
# Added the current day and date to the bottom of my jumbotron while linking my javascript file to the bottom of my HTML.
# Made the mistake of not saving or pushing and lost all progress.
